# A Novel Biomimetic Approach to Red Teaming A.I. Models

This repository contains all materials related to a novel experiment in cognitive red teaming of large language models (LLMs), simulating five neurocognitive profiles: ADHD, Amnesia, OCD, Schizophrenia, and Split-brain Syndrome. Each profile was paired with emotionally and technically diverse prompts, and responses were tagged both manually and heuristically.

## Contents
- âœ… Fully tagged dataset of 57 prompt-response pairs
- ðŸ“ˆ Heatmaps and visual diagnostics
- ðŸ§  Streamlit tagging interface (manual + auto)
- ðŸ“Š Final report (illustrated, submission-ready)
- ðŸ“‚ Scripts to regenerate the full analysis

## Folders
- `data/`: CSVs + heatmaps
- `scripts/`: Python tools for tagging and reporting
- `docs/`: Word report and appendix with human justifications
- `figures/`: Chart assets
